## Setup
```{r}
# first, source our libraries
source(here::here("libraries.R"))

# download our data from mlbench and take a peek at it
df_trees <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-01-28/sf_trees.csv")
glimpse(df_trees) # 5 numerics, 7 chars, legal_status is our target
```

## Splitting Our Data
```{r}
# create our split
split_trees <- initial_split(df_trees, strata = legal_status) # specify stratification 

# split into train and test
train_trees <- training(split_trees)
test_trees <- testing(split_trees)
```

## Build a recipe

```{r}
# create a recipe object which we will use as an input into our tidymodels functions
rec_trees <- recipe(legal_status ~ ., data = train_trees) %>%
  # update tree_id's "role" so we don't have to drop it 
  update_role(tree_id, new_role = "ID") %>%
  # groups any factor level that is represented in 1% or less of the data into "other"
  step_other(species, caretaker, threshold = 0.01) %>%
  # same as above, but for site_info and at 0.05% 
  step_other(site_info, threshold = 0.005) %>%
  # dummify all char vars, excluding our outcome (legal_status)
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>%
  # convert the date to numeric years
  step_date(date, features = c("year")) %>%
  # remove original date variable
  step_rm(date) %>%
  # ???
  step_downsample(legal_status)

# # the code defining our recipe only defined it; to execute it we have to run prep()
# trees_prep <- prep(rec_trees) # cannot allocate vector of size 39.1 gb?
# 
# # and to get the altered data out we have to juice() the prepped recipe
# trees_juiced <- juice(tree_prep)
```

## Generate our models with any parameters we want to tune
```{r}
# svm
mod_svm_trees <-
  # choose the model and any hyperparameters we want to tune
  svm_rbf(cost = tune(), rbf_sigma = tune()) %>%
  # set whether its for classification or regression
  set_mode("classification") %>%
  # set the engine as whatever underlying package we want to run the formula 
  set_engine("kernlab")

```

## Put our recipe and model together into a workflow object
```{r}
# save a workflow object
wf_trees <- 
  # call workflow() to set up the skeleton
  workflow() %>% 
  # add a recipe
  add_recipe(rec_trees) %>% 
  # add a model
  add_model(mod_svm_trees)
```

## Set additional tuning parameters
```{r}
# set a seed
set.seed(19)

# OPTIONAL: cross-validation 
folds_trees <- rsample::vfold_cv(train_trees)

# OPTIONAL: tuning grid numbers
grid_trees <- 20 

# # OPTIONAL: parallelization plan
# plan(multisession)
# availableCores() # check available cores

## NOTE: Multicore sessions and parallelization work on almost every operating system EXCEPT
## for Windows! 
```

## Execute tuning
```{r}

# # create and execute our tuning formula
# tuning_trees %<-% {
#   # specify a model that we have already defined
#   mod_svm %>%
#   # set our tuning grid to our parameters of interest
#   tune_grid(
#     iono_rec,
#     resamples = folds_trees,
#     control = tree_grid
#   )
# }

# create and execute our tuning formula
tuning_trees <- mod_svm %>%
  # set our tuning grid to our parameters of interest
  tune_grid(
    rec_trees,
    resamples = folds_trees,
    grid = grid_trees
  )
```
